  <h2>Work/Education History </h2>
  <hr>

<p>I am Tajudeen Timilehin Adeyemi, I go by Tim or Taj for simpliity. I am currently 24. I am working at Equitable Bank 
as a mortgage underwriter, I have been at the bank since 2018. My previous work experience includes a stint at KPMG Nigeria, 
Brookfield GIS and Teach for India.  </p>
<p>
In my stint as a rotational associate in the finance department, I helped migrate the bank's HELOC reporting from Excel to Tableau, 
this allowed HELOC reporting to be centralized within the financial reporting department in the bank. I developed 
and maintained financial models and outputs that are distributed to management on a monthly and quarterly basis.
</p>
<p>
  In my stint as a rotational associate in the digital banking department, I assisted in creating a business case for a referral
  program for our EQ Bank platform. In addition, I worked as a data analyst for the department which included ad-hoc requests from
  the manager as well as managing and updatng the Tableau dashboards for EQ Bank. During the course of my stay, I strengthened my
  Tableau and SQL skills
</p>
<p>
  At KPMG, I managed our clientâ€™s reputation risk through conducting thorough background checks on potential vendors.
 I also analyzed legal and financial documents during the forensic audit stage to uncover instances of fraud/impropriety.
</p>

<p>
  At Teach for India, I worked with a group of three to investigate strategies to help the charity recruit higher 
  quality students for their program. We performed primary and secondary research to help us identify key areas for strengths. 
  We identified a more diverse pool of target schools from which Teach for India can expand their recruitments.
</p>
<p>My educational focus has revolved around business. In my undergraduate, I studied Finance and Economics at Rotman Commerce. 
  After my undergrad, I moved to London, Ontario to study International Business at Western University which included a work-study 
  trip to India.
